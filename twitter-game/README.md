Hi there, thanks so much for this opportunity!

I coded my project in React. To run this program, cd into the "twitter-game" folder and run the command "npm start"

The basic functionality of the game is complete however I would have liked to have given the users the ability to play with other twitter handles but I ran out of time. I would have implememented this by inserting a form element and having it set the user1 and user2 states (which held the twitter handles for the game) to whatever the user desired.

Another feature I would have liked to have added was getting the Twitter profile pictures of the two users to display on the screen next to their buttons but I was stumped.

I hope you enjoy and I hope to hear from you all soon.
